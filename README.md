## Description

This game is heavily inspired by Achtung, die Kurve!

It's a 4 player local multiplayer game. You control a spaceship, and need to stay alive as long as possible before there's no space to navigate. You die if you hit a player's trail or any of the walls.

### Player controls:

- p1: left arrow, right arrow
- p2: q, a
- p3: v, b
- p4: o, p

### Web Monetization challenge:

You can select additional space ship skins for your ship.

### NEAR challenge:

You can write your name, and it will be stored on the smart contract. The name also determines the color of your spaceship if you are logged in to NEAR's wallet.

### Protocol labs challenge:

The three other ships' color are chosen based on Drand. They all start with a default color, but the color will change if the client receives a response from Drand before a round har started.
