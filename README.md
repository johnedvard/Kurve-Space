# Game template

This is a template that can be used in game dev projects or game jams. It's mainly focused on TypeScript and webpack projects.

## How to use

This template comes with many optional dependencies. These are added for convenience because I personally like to use them. If you don't feel like using Near, or Kontra, just ignore them, remove them or replace them.

```
npm run install
npmrun start
```

## Monetization

This template includes web monetization. Change the payment pointer to your own, or support me by using the default one

## Decentralized app (dapp)

This template is using Near. Replace all dev-1618829854588-2430734 (my own testnet) with your own testnet Near smart contract id
